# Project: Regex Engine
### About
Regular expressions are a fundamental part of computer science and natural language processing. In this project, you will write an extendable regex engine that can handle basic regex syntax, including literals (a, b, c, etc.), wild-cards (.), and metacharacters (?, *, +, ^, $).
### Learning outcomes
Learn about the regex syntax, practice working with parsing and slicing, and get more familiar with boolean algebra and recursion.
### This project is a part of the following track
Python Developer
## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
### Stage 1/6: Single character strings
Implement a program that compares two single character strings (including the wildcard) and determines if there's a match.
### Stage 2/6: Matching two equal length strings
Extend your engine to compare two equal length strings using recursion.
### Stage 3/6: Working with strings of different length
Add the ability to compare a regex to strings that vary in length.
### Stage 4/6: Implementing the operators ^ and $
Extend the engine to handle the operators ^ and $ that control the position of the regex within a string.
### Stage 5/6: Controlling repetition
Support the additional operators ?, *, and + that control the repetition of a character within a string.
### Stage 6/6: Escaping
Finally, implement the backslash \ as an escape symbol that allows to use metacharacters as literals.
